            All the States and Governments by which men are or ever have been ruled,
            have been and are either Republics or Princedoms. Princedoms are either
            hereditary, in which the sovereignty is derived through an ancient line
            of ancestors, or they are new. New Princedoms are either wholly new, as
            that of Milan to Francesco Sforza; or they are like limbs joined on to
            the hereditary possessions of the Prince who acquires them, as the
            Kingdom of Naples to the dominions of the King of Spain. The States thus
            acquired have either been used to live under a Prince or have been free;
            and he who acquires them does so either by his own arms or by the arms of
            others, and either by good fortune or by merit.
